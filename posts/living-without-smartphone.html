        <p>I wake up. The first reach in the morning. Where does it lead? Of course, to my smartphone. Checking if I have new messages. Checking if I've gotten a few more likes.</p>

        <p>Checking if something sensational has happened in the world. <strong>Living without a smartphone</strong> and starting the day? Difficult.</p>

        <p>Do you know this feeling just as well as I do?</p>

        <h2>Why Are We So Programmed?</h2>

        <p>Why are we now so programmed that exactly this scenario determines the start of the day for millions of younger (and increasingly older) people?</p>

        <p>What benefit do you actually get from this <em>morning routine</em>?</p>

        <h2>My Wake-Up Call</h2>

        <p>Imagine. Today, I actually got up and my first reach was for my iPhone. I looked towards the bed's edge to aim for my target.</p>

        <p>Where was my iPhone?</p>

        <p>A glance to the floor and I knew where it was. It must have fallen during the night. How unwise of me. Placing it on the bed's edge. But I just wanted to charge it overnight. Like every night. You have to charge your smartphone daily nowadays!</p>

        <p>And what can I tell you? What happened to the device?</p>

        <p>It wouldn't turn on. Done. No signal. Nothing. Great, such a nice thing. What a "successful" start to the day. Here we have another wonderful example of an established routine.</p>

        <h2>Breaking Free From Digital Dependency</h2>

        <p>Since I've been dealing with saying goodbye to my iPhone for some time now, it wasn't too difficult for me to get through the day today. Just imagine <em>how much time you'll regain during the day if you don't have a smartphone</em>. Yes, that seems unimaginable, right? In two ways, of course.</p>

        <p>What I actually want to show and convey to you is that we've fallen into a <strong>dependency relationship</strong> with these mobile devices far too much nowadays. In the past, people would sit in the tram and talk to the person next to them. Whether an older lady or a classmate. They didn't constantly stare at their mobile screen.</p>

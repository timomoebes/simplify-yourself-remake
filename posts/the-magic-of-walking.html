        <p>Hey, did you know that Steve Jobs was not just a genius in technology, but also in creativity? He had his best ideas while walking. Yes, you heard that right. Not in the office, not in front of the computer, but while walking.</p>

        <p>Why did he do this? <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2014/04/24/walking-vs-sitting-042414/" target="_blank">Stanford University investigated exactly this in 2014</a>. They took 176 people and put them in different situations: treadmill, walking outside, sitting inside, sitting outside. And then? They had to be creative. And what came out? While walking, they were significantly more creative than while sitting. One group even increased their creativity by 60%. I find that outstanding!</p>

        <h2>Why Walking Boosts Creativity</h2>
        
        <p>Now you're probably wondering: Why is this? Walking brings more oxygen to the brain... The rhythm of your steps can work like a meditation. And without a phone, music, or podcasts in your ears, you can finally think clearly.</p>

        <p>But Steve Jobs wasn't the only one who knew this. Great thinkers, artists, and athletes have always recognized the power of walking. Even the philosopher S√∏ren Kierkegaard was a fan. He said: "I walk myself into my best thoughts and run away from every illness."</p>

        <h2>Your Walking Challenge</h2>
        
        <p>What does this mean for you? It's time for you to try this too. My challenge for you: Go for a 30-minute walk every day this week without technology. No phone, no music, no distractions. Just you, your thoughts, and the world around you.</p>

        <p>Notice how your mind starts to wander, how new ideas emerge, and how problems suddenly seem solvable. This is the magic of walking in action.</p>
